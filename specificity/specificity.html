        The cascade, and the closely-related concept of specificity, are mechanisms that control 
        which rule applies when there is such a conflict. Which rule is styling your element 
        may not be the one you expect, so you need to understand how these mechanisms work.

        Reference for Specificity


        The following list of selector types increases by specificity:

        Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., ::before).
        Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) 
                                                    and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).
        ID selectors (e.g., #example).
